This week was a lot of fun in patching several Exchange environments in regards to CVE-2025-53786. The HCW was executed with the new option to configure a dedicated Exchange hybrid application in Microsoft Entra ID. As a final step, the cleanup script was fired but we noticed that there was not a lot of output regarding certificates and additional info. So we quickly created a script that checks the older shared service principal and also the newly created dedicated Exchange hybrid application in Microsoft Entra ID.

If you manage Exchange hybrid deployments, it’s worth validating service principals and certificates after automated changes, a quick verification script can save hours of troubleshooting. Happy to share the script or walk through the checks. Send me a message on LinkedIn if you need me!

## What It Does
- Connects to Microsoft Graph for your chosen tenant (supports UPN, tenant domain, or custom domain input)
- Checks both App Registration and Service Principal for Exchange Online ("Office 365 Exchange Online")
- Lists and validates all certificates and client secrets, highlighting expired or missing credentials
- Generates a detailed HTML report for your records

## Why Use This Script?
This is a ready-to-use PowerShell script to help admins quickly check if their tenant is potentially impacted by CVE-2025-53786. It does not remediate, but gives clear visibility into certificate status for Exchange Online identities.

## Usage
1. Run the script in PowerShell with the required Microsoft Graph permissions (Application.Read.All).
2. Follow the prompts to select your tenant.
3. Review the on-screen results and the generated HTML report.

> **Note:** This script is for validation only. Always review official Microsoft guidance for mitigation steps.
